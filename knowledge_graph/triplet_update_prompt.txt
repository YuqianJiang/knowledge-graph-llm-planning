I have a knowledge graph that represents a household. A state change in the household
is provided below. A set of relevant relations in the knowledge graph is also provided.
Based on the state change, determine which of the relations should be removed and what
new relations should be added. Only add and remove relations that are strictly necessary
for the state update.

Provide your response in the following format:
```
REMOVE:
<list of relations to remove>
---------------------
ADD:
<list of relations to add>
```

Here is an example:
```
---------------------
STATE CHANGE: I moved the knife to the sink.
---------------------
RELEVANT RELATIONS:
Knife_e6601c42 -> isPlacedAt -> Cabinet_78f721d5
Knife_e6601c42 -> isInteractable -> False
Knife_e6601c42 -> mass -> 018000000715255737
Knife_e6601c42 -> isPickedUp -> False
Sink_f2ecbf04 -> visible -> False
Sink_f2ecbf04 -> isInteractable -> False
SinkBasin_25ff5803 -> isInteractable -> False
Faucet_7d5afe1e -> visible -> False
---------------------
REMOVE:
Knife_e6601c42 -> isPlacedAt -> Cabinet_78f721d5

ADD:
Knife_e6601c42 -> isPlacedAt -> SinkBasin_25ff5803
```

Here is the real problem:
---------------------
STATE CHANGE: {state_change}
---------------------
RELEVANT RELATIONS:
{filtered_triplet_str}
---------------------
