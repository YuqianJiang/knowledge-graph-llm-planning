I have a knowledge graph that represents a household. A state change in the household
is provided below. A set of relevant relations in the knowledge graph is also provided.
Based on the state change, determine which of the relations should be removed and what
new relations should be added. Only add and remove relations that are strictly necessary
for the state update.

Provide your response in the following format:
```
REMOVE:
<list of relations to remove>
---------------------
ADD:
<list of relations to add>
```

Here is an example:
```
---------------------
STATE CHANGE: I moved the bowl to the living room table.
---------------------
RELEVANT RELATIONS:
living_room -> instance_of -> room
stephanie_bedroom -> instance_of -> room
living_room -> has -> living_room_table
bowl -> is_placed_at -> stephanie_bedroom_shelf
bowl -> on_shelf -> stephanie_br_shelf_1
bowl -> instance_of -> kitchenware
stephanie_bedroom -> has -> stephanie_bedroom_shelf
stephanie_bedroom_shelf -> has -> stephanie_br_shelf_1
stephanie_bedroom_shelf -> has -> stephanie_br_shelf_2
stephanie_bedroom_shelf -> has -> stephanie_br_shelf_3
stephanie_bedroom_shelf -> has -> stephanie_br_shelf_4
stephanie_bedroom_shelf -> in_room -> stephanie_bedroom
stephanie_bedroom_shelf -> instance_of -> shelf
stephanie_br_shelf_1 -> instance_of -> surface
stephanie_bedroom -> instance_of -> room
stephanie_br_shelf_2 -> instance_of -> surface
stephanie_br_shelf_3 -> instance_of -> surface
stephanie_br_shelf_4 -> instance_of -> surface
---------------------
REMOVE:
bowl -> is_placed_at -> stephanie_bedroom_shelf
bowl -> on_shelf -> stephanie_br_shelf_1

ADD:
bowl -> is_placed_at -> living_room_table
```

Here is the real problem:
---------------------
STATE CHANGE: {state_change}
---------------------
RELEVANT RELATIONS:
{filtered_triplet_str}
---------------------
